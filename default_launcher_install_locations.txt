    Manifest location = C:\ProgramData\Epic\EpicGamesLauncher\Data\Manifests (All files have the .ITEM extension, but contain valid JSON. These files can be for a game or DLC (called add-on).)
    Item type is defined in both AppCategories and TechnicalType: games means the item is a game, addons means the item is DLC.
    It appears that DLC can be matched with the game itself by checking the CatalogNamespace/MainGameCatalogNamespace
    
    Sid Meier's Civilization VI launch url = com.epicgames.launcher://apps/cd14dcaa4f3443f19f7169a980559c62%3A42ac1ee840304cb1807172a9b47dc8e3%3AKinglet?action=launch&silent=true -> 
    - cd14dcaa4f3443f19f7169a980559c62 looks to be the CatalogNamespace/MainGameCatalogNamespace
    - 3A42ac1ee840304cb1807172a9b47dc8e3 is unidentified as of yet
    - 3AKinglet is unidentified as of yet, looks like it has something to do with AppName/MainGameAppName
    - % looks to be the separator

    ExpectingDLCInstalled consists of a key-value pair -> the key is made up by the CatalogNamespace, a colon, the CatalogItemId of the DLC, a colon again, and the DLC's AppName. The value is set to true (Don't yet know when this would be set to anything other than true).
